## ðŸš€ Features Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Core OOP Principles

- **Abstraction** â†’ Hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary features.  
- **Encapsulation** â†’ (via methods and constructors) binding data with functions.  
- **Inheritance** â†’ Reusing code from parent classes.  
- **Polymorphism** â†’ Same interface, different behavior.
